# MemeRater

MemeRater is a browser-based meme evaluation system that leverages modern machine learning and computer vision technologies to intelligently analyze, extract features from, and rate memes. It is designed to simulate subjective meme analysis by combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and TensorFlow.js-based neural network inference.

This project is ideal for developers, researchers, or meme enthusiasts interested in applied machine learning, computer vision, or building modern frontend experiences. It is built entirely with modern JavaScript and TypeScript tooling, making it fast, efficient, and extensible.

## Overview

MemeRater allows users to upload meme images, which are then analyzed using an OCR engine to extract embedded text and a machine learning model to compute a rating based on multiple input features. The system is optimized for performance using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and modular TypeScript components.

Unlike basic image manipulation tools or hardcoded classifiers, MemeRater is built to generalize across various meme formats, leveraging deep learning for image-text correlation and humor scoring. The project is entirely frontend-based and runs in the browser without server-side dependencies.

## Features

- Upload and analyze static image memes directly from the browser
- Use of `Tesseract.js` for high-accuracy text extraction from meme images
- Deep learning model powered by `TensorFlow.js` to compute meme ratings
- Fully responsive UI built with `Tailwind CSS`
- Vite-powered development workflow for fast builds and hot module replacement
- Modular and maintainable codebase using TypeScript
